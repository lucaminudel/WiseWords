# Workspace notes

- before making any changes present me with a list of the individual changes, specifying which files will be changed and how and ask me before proceeding, if I want to make one chnage at the time and verify it before moving to the next or if I want to do all the changes
- When I comment or add clarifications or requests to the list of of changes you present to me etc. present me again with the details of the files and changes you intend to do and ask me agein to proceed with the next step you have detailed or to complete to complete the whole list in one go
- when you create C# or TypeScript code, follows this design style: prefer Simple Design, Simplicity and KISS and YAGNI principles and low coupling. Apply DRY and SOLID principles and separation of concerns. Apply  Dependency Inversion Principle and inject the dependencies and configuration information in the constructor avoiding to call public static methods inside a class.  Apply the law of Demeter and avoid using getters and setters, instead prefer smart handlers AKA visitor pattern. Prefer immutable classes where it make sense, prefer composition over inheritance where it is possible. Make the code easy to read and understand and the intent of the code explicit. Apply the same design principles to the tests and the test data. In the tests use builders for the test data to avoid duplication and make the tests easy to read and understand. Use builders with fluent interfaces.
